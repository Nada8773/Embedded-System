In this lab you will build a switch interface that implements positive logic, and you will build an LED interface that implements positive 
logic.  You will interface them to your TM4C123. Overal
1) the pin to which we connect the switch is moved to PE0, 
2) you will have to remove the PUR initialization because pull up is no longer needed. 
3) the pin to which we connect the LED is moved to PE1,
4) the switch is changed from negative to positive logic
5) you should decrease the delay so it flashes about 5 Hz. 
To flash at 5 Hz means the LED comes on 5 times per second. If the switch is pressed we turn on the LED for 100 ms,
turn off the LED for 100 ms, and repeat.
